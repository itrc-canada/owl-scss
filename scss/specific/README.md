> Create subfolders for specific templates


For overrides, ideally you should change as little as possible from the core file to the customization. Only overwrite parameters you need to (you can reference the `/basic` template for an example)
  

If you're making new styles be sure to include the underscore at the beginning of the filename to prevent it from being compiled.
